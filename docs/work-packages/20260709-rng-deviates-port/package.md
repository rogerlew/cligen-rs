# RNG + Deviates Port (with the QC/ACM chain)

Status: `STAGE-C-R1-COMPLETE` (handed back for Claude Code Stage R2;
package not closed)
Date: 2026-07-09
Evidence mode: Stages S/C/R1 — Ran (tap capture, direct vectors,
full-stream identity, independent review, all gates; see
`artifacts/gate-results.md`)

Stage S outcome: tap schema + non-invasive patch + 12-fixture capture
(non-invasiveness proven by golden byte-identity); `randn`/`dstn1`/
`ks_tst`/`dstg` ported with **full-stream bit-identity** — 19,784,955 +
26,402,148 + 30,268 records, QC-regeneration draws included; state
structs (`Crandom3State`, `Cbk7Seeds`, `DstgState`) and
SPEC-GENERATOR-CORE established; the f32 transcendental adjudication
resolved by exhaustive evidence (`libm_pinned`, standard §1.3 amended);
handoff + Codex kickoff in `artifacts/`.

Stage C/R1 outcome: `jdt`/`jlt`, `conflm`/`confls`, the complete
15-unit ACM cluster, and `ranset` are ported under the spine's state and
precision patterns. The copied Stage C tap supplies a 919-record direct
fixture and 2,584 full per-call ranset records; the ignored release gate is
bit-identical across both Stage S streams and the entire ranset capture. The
named `mox=0` under-run is characterized and fails closed. R1 reviewed both
stages, fixed all six findings, resolved the ARM math license provenance,
and reran every gate green. Stage R2 remains the sole closing stage.
Execution model: staged, two executors (operator-ratified 2026-07-09) —
Claude Code writes the design-setting spine; Codex completes the
mechanical volume and runs gates; each reviews the other; Claude holds
the final sanity review after handback.

## Objective

Port the first generator code under faithful-mode acceptance: `randn`,
`ranset`, `dstn1`, `dstg` plus the QC/ACM chain they call (`ks_tst`,
`conflm`, `confls`, the ACM special-function cluster) and the calendar
utilities — ROADMAP item 3, covering ratified port-order steps 1–2. The
package also establishes the patterns every later port package imitates:
the common-block state structs, the tap schema, and the faithful-mode
function shapes. `nrmd` and `chitst` are ratified dead and are not
ported.

## Acceptance (whole package)

Bit-identical deviate streams against Fortran taps for **all fixture
seeds, including the QC-regeneration draws** (the QC-rejection path
consumes extra RNG draws; a port that skips it diverges silently). Tap
comparison is on exact bit patterns, not decimal renderings — the tap
format decision (Stage S) must make comparisons formatting-proof.

## Stages

### Stage S — Spine (Claude Code)

Design-setting work; everything downstream imitates it.

1. **Tap schema + patch**: define what interior values are tapped
   (uniform stream from `randn`, normal stream from `dstn1`, gamma
   stream + rejection/QC-regeneration events from `dstg`, seed state
   snapshots from `ranset`) and the emission format (bit-exact — e.g.
   hex/raw — so no decimal-formatting ambiguity enters acceptance). The
   patch is recorded under `artifacts/`, applied to a copied build tree,
   never to `reference/`. Capture tap fixtures for all golden-fixture
   seeds using the pinned build profile from the fixture-harness
   provenance.
2. **State structs**: `Crandom3State` (seed integers, `ranary` with the
   nine views as accessor methods, f64 `g_dsum`/`g_ssum` accumulators),
   plus the minimal slices of other blocks that `ranset` reads —
   establishing the block-to-struct pattern of coding standard §5,
   block-data initializers as cited constructors.
3. **Ports**: `randn`, `dstn1`, `ks_tst` (on the `dstg` acceptance
   path), `dstg` (the f64 `fu`/`xx` island, `SAVE` state as struct
   fields, the QC-filter call seam) — each with attribution header,
   symbol glossary, precision-map annotation, and bit-identity tests
   against the tap fixtures.
4. **SPEC-GENERATOR-CORE** (seed/state surface: how seeds enter, what
   state flows, faithful-mode signature shapes) — authored, registered.
5. **Spine handoff**: `artifacts/spine-handoff.md` naming the
   established patterns, the remaining unit list, and the exact
   acceptance commands; plus the Codex kickoff prompt (authored at spine
   completion so it cites real code, not intentions).

### Stage C — Completion + gates (Codex)

Within the spine's patterns: `conflm`, `confls`, the ACM cluster
(`cdfchi` … `spmpar` — uniformly f64; `ENTRY` points `dstinv`/`dstzr` as
separate functions on shared state per standard §5), `ranset` (seed
init + QC battery), `jdt`/`jlt`. Full-matrix bit-identity tests (every
fixture seed, QC-regeneration draws included) and all gates: fmt, clippy
`-D warnings`, test, CRAP ≤ 30 via llvm-cov + cargo-crap.

### Stage R1 — Cross-review (Codex)

Independent review of the whole package **including the spine** —
transcription fidelity against source lines, precision-map compliance,
state-translation compliance, test/evidence alignment. Findings to
`artifacts/review-codex.md`; accepted findings fixed before handback.

### Stage R2 — Final sanity review (Claude Code)

After handback: spot-verification of Codex's stage (gates re-run,
tap-identity re-run, targeted source-vs-port reads of the highest-risk
units — `ranset`, `dstg` seam, one ACM `ENTRY` translation), review of
R1 dispositions, close or bounce with named blockers.
`artifacts/final-review-claude.md`.

## Scope exclusions

- No `nrmd`/`chitst` (dead). No daily/storm/mode/output units. No
  native-f64 mode. No `.cli` emission. No profile/provenance surfaces
  beyond what SPEC-GENERATOR-CORE itself needs.

## Authority

- `reference/cligen532/cligen.f` per ADR-0001 (unit lines in the
  ratified decomposition §2); precision sites per the ratification
  census; tap constraint carried from the fixture-harness provenance
  (interior-taps deferral note).

## Gates

- Stage C: fmt / clippy `-D warnings` / test / CRAP ≤ 30; full-seed-matrix
  tap bit-identity including QC-regeneration draws.
- Stage S ports carry their own bit-identity tests before Stage C begins.
- Reviews dispositioned before close; final close by Stage R2.

## Exit criteria

`EXECUTED-COMPLETE`: all in-scope units ported and bit-identical against
taps across the fixture seed matrix; SPEC-GENERATOR-CORE registered;
both reviews dispositioned; gates green. Holds: tap capture cannot
reproduce deterministically (name the source); a unit cannot meet
bit-identity within the faithful precision map (stop and characterize —
do not widen tolerances).
